## 🌟 About The Project

This project combines a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend powered by the Google Gemini API. The core of the application is the AI's persona, which is carefully crafted through a detailed system prompt to mimic Rohit Negi's unique way of speaking—a mix of Hindi and English, using his signature phrases and emojis.

The goal is to provide a more engaging and relatable learning experience than a generic chatbot.

## ✨ Features

-   **🤖 Authentic AI Persona**: The bot responds in Rohit Negi's voice—friendly, encouraging, and bilingual (Hindi/English).
-   **🚀 Landing Page**: A clean entry point to start a new chat session.
-   **💬 Modern Chat Interface**: A responsive and intuitive chat UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
-   **📜 Chat History**: Conversations are saved to `localStorage`, allowing you to pick up where you left off.
-   **🗂️ Multi-Chat Management**: Create new chats and switch between them easily via a collapsible sidebar.
-   **✍️ Markdown & Code Support**: Bot responses are rendered with Markdown, including beautifully syntax-highlighted code blocks (using Prism.js).
-   **📋 Copy Code**: A one-click "Copy" button on every code block.
-   **🎤 Voice-to-Text**: Use your microphone to dictate messages directly into the chat input.
-   **🌓 Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes for your viewing comfort.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Syed373/Rohit-Negi-AI-Mentor.git
    cd rohit-negi-ai-mentor
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create the Environment File:**
    In the `backend` directory, create a new file named `.env` and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    API_KEY = YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    ⚠️ **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The provided `.gitignore` file should already prevent this.

4.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    In your first terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
    ```sh
    node ChatBot.js
    ```
    You should see the message: `✅ Server is running on http://localhost:3000`

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    In your second terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can open your browser to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
